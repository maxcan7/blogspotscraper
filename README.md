# Blogspotscraper
A Python 3 script for scraping a Blogspot blog recursively. Saves each post as a new html file, which is cleaned from most of its html code.

This is a forked and modified version of the original script located here: https://github.com/christopherkullenberg/blogspotscraper

### Requirements
This script uses BeautifulSoup. Install with:

    pip3 install beautifulsoup4

### Usage
1. Change the `url` variable in ths ehsll script
2. Run in bash with `blogspotscraper_run.sh`
3. Abort scraping by pressing CTLC-C. Or the script will continue until there are no more posts left (or you get banned for over-using bandwidth)

### Limitations
This script does NOT work with the official Google blogs hosted on blogspot. It has only been tested from a Swedish IP-number, so it might not work if some URL redirection happens.

This is just a quick and dirty script that could work as a scaffold for writing more precise scraping features.

Known error: Some Blogspot blogs have a different way of handling unique posts. If the script does not work, change the following line:

    div = soup.find(id="post-body-" + findID[0]) #This retrieves each post content

to

    div = soup.find("div", class_="post-body")

### Warning!
By repeatedly downloading web pages, you might get temporarily banned from the service. Use on your own risk.
